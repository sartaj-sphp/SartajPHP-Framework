# ❌ Anti-Pattern: Framework Hallucination

## INVALID ASSUMPTIONS

- `$request`
- `$response`
- `$this->render()`
- `$this->view()`
- `$this->post()`

## Why This Is Invalid

These belong to:
- Laravel
- Symfony
- Express
- MVC frameworks

SartajPHP does NOT provide these APIs.

NEVER invent framework helpers.
